# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple icon placeholders using any image editor or online tool.
The icons should represent the ThredUp Price Checker extension.

Suggested design:
- Green background (matching the discount badge color #10b981)
- White "%" symbol or shopping bag icon
- Simple, clean design

## Placeholder Notice

For development purposes, you can temporarily use placeholder images or remove the icons section from manifest.json.
The extension will still function without icons, but they are required for publishing to the Chrome Web Store.
